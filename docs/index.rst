Welcome to django-crowdsourcing's documentation!
================================================

django-crowdsourcing, hereafter just crowdsourcing, is a tool for making surveys and displaying the results. Your questions can be drop down lists, image uploads, video links, addresses, and more. You can display pie charts, maps, slideshows, graphs, an archive of the results, and more.

Crowdsourcing uses the Django admin. You set up surveys which consist of a list of questions. Users create submissions which consist of answers to those questions. You may set up survey reports which describe how you want to display those submissions.

Crowdsourcing has some tools that help you embed survey entry forms and survey reports anywhere on your website.

Crowdsourcing is open source and under active development, so expect great new features soon.

If your website runs on django and you want some slick surveys, crowdsourcing is a good way to go. It's easy enough to handle simple polls with pie charts, yet it's powerful enough to handle complicated surveys with rich multimedia responses plotted on a map with custom icons.
