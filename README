django-crowdsourcing is a survey application that began life as a fork
of Doug Napoleone's django-survey to meet a couple of objectives:

1. survey creation can be done effectively in the django admin.
2. there is support for photo uploads and video embeds.
3. results are available via a JSON api.
4. depending on the nature of a survey, submissions may be  displayed in 
   archives as well as aggregated in various ways.

Running The Example App
1. $ easy_install pip
2. $ pip install -r crowdsourcing_requirements.txt
3. $ pip install -r example_app/example_app_requirements.txt
4. By default the example app will use a sqlite db; if if you want to
   change that, modify example_app/local_settings.py accordingly.
5. $ cd example_app
6. $ ./manage.py syncdb
7. $ ./manage.py runserver 
8. Add some surveys in /admin/

Notes
1. Should work under Django 1.1 and 1.2
2. Only tested on Python 2.6
