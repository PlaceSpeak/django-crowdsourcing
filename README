django-crowdsourcing is a survey application that began life as a fork
of Doug Napoleone's django-survey to meet a couple of objectives:

1. survey creation can be done effectively in the django admin.
2. there is support for photo uploads and video embeds.
3. results are available via a JSON api.
4. depending on the nature of a survey, submissions may be  displayed in 
   archives as well as aggregated in various ways.
